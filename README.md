# Xest Window Manager

Check out the Wiki for a lot of information in addition to the Readme.

## What is it?

Xest in a window manager for Xorg inspired by projects like XMonad and i3. Xest is currently being tested and could be used for real work although be warned that if something crashes, you will probably lose anything you had open.

This project aims to improve upon other window managers by allowing the arbitrary nesting of different Tilers. A Tiler is a way of organizing windows. For example, a Tiler might organize windows horizontally, vertically, or as workspaces. The wiki has more information.

Xest also features Vim-like modes. In the default config, pressing Super brings you to Normal mode and pressing Escape brings you to Insert mode. Sometimes though, you only want to enter a couple of commands in the new mode. To make that easier, you can hold down the mode change key to temporarily enter the new mode. Temporarily entering a mode is extremely similar to how pretty much every program except Vim works. Temporarily entering a mode might be broken in the current release so you'll have to press the escape key pretty often.

## How does it work?

Check out the Wiki or the source code. Note that the quality of the code varies
drastically between functions and files. In the future, I would love to add more
documentation and reorganize a bit.

The wiki has installation instructions and binary files can be found under
releases.
