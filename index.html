            <h1 id="what-is-xest">What is Xest?</h1>
<p>Xest is an X11 Window Manager with both tiling and floating support. It is inspired by other projects like i3 and XMonad.</p>
<p>The defining characteristic of Xest is its tree-like nesting. Xest isn’t unique because it represents layouts and windows like a tree; i3 does this already. What makes Xest unique is the direct control users have over the tree. This increase in control allows you to do things like nesting workspaces.</p>
<h1 id="what-does-this-mean-in-practice">What does this mean in practice?</h1>
<p>Imagine you have two projects you’re working on. One of them is a research paper and the other is some kind of coding project. Normally, these two projects will be hard to organize on your desktop.</p>
<p>For the research papaer, maybe you have a workspace designated to finding sources in your web browser and a workspace with LibreOffice open.</p>
<p>For the programming project, you might need a workspace with your browser open with documentation, a workspace with you text editor, and a workspace with a couple of terminals for compiling or testing.</p>
<p>The question quickly becomes how to organize the two projects. Do you put the research workspaces before or after the project workspaces? What do you do if you need another workspace for one of them? Is moving between everything easy? Is it easier just to close everything related to one project while you work on another?</p>
<p>Xest’s solution to this problem is nested workspaces. At the top level, you have two workspaces open: one for the research paper and one for the programming. Inside of those, you have workspaces for each project. You can now pretend like only one of them exists at a time making it easier to work without distractions. You can also make better use of muscle memory. Your web browser can always be on the first workspace no matter what you’re working on.</p>
<h1 id="how-stable-is-xest">How stable is Xest?</h1>
<p>Although I am currently using it pretty much full time, there are still bugs and changes to be made. I am still not sold on the primitive operations currently available for moving around the desktop so those are likely to change. If you have ideas, I would be excited to hear them.</p>
<p>I try to fix as many bugs as I can, but I can’t hit every possible use case. If Xest crashes, every program you had running will crash as well which could mean losing work. Make sure to save often!</p>
<h1 id="i-want-to-try-it-out">I want to try it out!</h1>
<p>You can clone Xest from <a href="https://github.com/jhgarner/Xest-Window-Manager">https://github.com/jhgarner/Xest-Window-Manager</a> and run the install.sh file to get going. You will need to install Haskell’s Stack build tool before installing since I have now idea how universal the precompiled files are.</p>
